Banking Program

```
Example set of inputs and desired outputs:
A desired input would be on the line account = input("\n Which account would you like to access checking or savings account? c/s \n") the input would be from the user c or s

balance_checking = input("\n What is the balance of your checking account? \n") this would be another desired input and the input would be a float number or an integer number.

balance_saving = input("\n What is the balance of your savings account? \n") this asks for the desired input of a balance. 

The output of these statements is actually determined later in the program:
        print(balance_checking - money)
This checks the value inserted for balance_checking and subtracts it from the desired amount inputted to be taken out.

Another example would be this:
	print(balance_saving - money)
This takes the value we inserted from balance_saving and subtracts it from money.
